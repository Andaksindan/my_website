<p class="meta">Sports · Soccer</p>
<p>The 2022 World Cup settled it. Messi is the greatest footballer of all time. The debate is over.</p>

<p>Eight Ballon d'Ors. 800+ goals. Dominated club football for two decades. But no World Cup. Critics said it mattered. They were wrong — but it stung.</p>
<h2>Qatar 2022: The Final Chapter</h2>
<p>Messi carried Argentina. Seven goals, three assists, sheer will. The final against France was instant classic. He won. The missing piece was complete.</p>
<h2>The Genius</h2>
<p>Messi doesn't rely on athleticism. It's vision, touch, timing. He sees the game three passes ahead. That's why he aged gracefully.</p>
<h2>Messi vs. Ronaldo</h2>
<p>Ronaldo has records. Messi has magic. One worked harder. One was born different. Both are legends. Only one has the World Cup.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
