<h1>The Miracle on Ice: 1980</h1>
<p class="meta">Sports · Hockey</p>
<p>A team of college kids beat the Soviet Union. It wasn't just a game. It was a moment that transcended sports.</p>
<h2>The Context: Cold War Tension</h2>
<p>1980. The Cold War was raging. The Soviets dominated hockey. They were professionals disguised as amateurs. The US team? College players.</p>
<h2>The Odds</h2>
<p>The Soviets had won gold in the last four Olympics. They destroyed the US 10-3 in an exhibition game days before. No one gave the Americans a chance.</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>The US took the lead. The Soviets tied it. Back and forth. Then Mike Eruzione scored. 4-3 USA. Ten minutes left. They held on.</p>
<h2>"Do You Believe in Miracles?"</h2>
<p>Al Michaels' call became iconic. The celebration was euphoric. Americans who didn't care about hockey cared about this.</p>
<h2>The Gold Medal Game</h2>
<p>People forget: they still had to beat Finland for gold. They did. 4-2. The miracle was complete.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Miracle on Ice wasn't just sports. It was a nation finding hope in a dark time. That's why it endures.</p>
