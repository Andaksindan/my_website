<h1>Serena Williams: Dominance and Defiance</h1>
<p class="meta">Sports · Tennis</p>
<p>23 Grand Slam titles. Decades of excellence. Endless obstacles. Serena is the greatest tennis player of all time.</p>
<h2>The Numbers</h2>
<p>319 weeks as world No. 1. Four Olympic golds. 23 Grand Slams. More than any player in the Open Era except Margaret Court — and Court's wins came in an easier era.</p>
<h2>The Adversity</h2>
<p>Racism. Sexism. Body-shaming. Biased officiating. Serena faced it all — and dominated anyway. That's what makes her legendary.</p>
<h2>The 2017 Australian Open</h2>
<p>She was eight weeks pregnant. She won the tournament anyway. Beat her sister Venus in the final. Unreal.</p>
<h2>The Rivalry With Venus</h2>
<p>They revolutionized tennis together. Competed against each other. Supported each other. Their bond transcends sports.</p>
<h2>The Retirement</h2>
<p>2022. She walked away on her terms. Not with a championship, but with dignity. The ovation at the US Open was deserved.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Serena didn't just win. She changed the sport. She redefined what was possible. And she did it while the world doubted her. That's greatness.</p>
