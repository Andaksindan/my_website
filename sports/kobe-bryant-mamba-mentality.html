<h1>Kobe Bryant's Mamba Mentality</h1>
<p class="meta">Sports · Basketball</p>
<p>Work harder. Outthink everyone. Never rest. Kobe turned obsession into philosophy — and it defined his legacy.</p>
<h2>What Is Mamba Mentality?</h2>
<p>Relentless focus. No shortcuts. No excuses. Every practice, every shot, every second was about improvement. Kobe didn't just play — he studied.</p>
<h2>The 4 AM Workouts</h2>
<p>While teammates slept, Kobe trained. He wasn't the most talented. But no one outworked him. That's how he became one of the greats.</p>
<h2>81 Points</h2>
<p>January 2006. Kobe scored 81 against the Raptors. Second-highest in NBA history. Pure domination. That's Mamba Mentality in action.</p>
<h2>The Achilles Injury</h2>
<p>Torn Achilles. He stayed on the court. Sank two free throws. Then walked off. That's dedication — or madness. Maybe both.</p>
<h2>The Tragic End</h2>
<p>2020. Helicopter crash. Gone at 41. The world mourned. His daughter Gianna died with him. The loss is still felt.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Kobe's mentality inspired millions. But it also cost him. The question is: was the sacrifice worth it? Kobe would say yes.</p>
