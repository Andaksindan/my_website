<h1>The 2008 Olympics: Usain Bolt's Coronation</h1>
<p class="meta">Sports · Track & Field</p>
<p>Beijing 2008. Usain Bolt broke three world records — and made it look easy. Speed had a new definition.</p>
<h2>The 100m: Showboating at 9.69</h2>
<p>He slowed down. Celebrated before the finish. Still broke the world record. Imagine if he'd tried. That's the absurdity of Bolt.</p>
<h2>The 200m: 19.30 Seconds</h2>
<p>This one he ran properly. The result? An untouchable world record. No one has come close since.</p>
<h2>The 4x100m Relay</h2>
<p>Jamaica set a world record. Bolt anchored. Three golds. Three world records. One Olympics. Unprecedented dominance.</p>
<h2>The Personality</h2>
<p>Bolt wasn't just fast. He was charismatic, playful, magnetic. He turned track and field into appointment viewing.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Bolt didn't just dominate his sport. He transcended it. And 2008 was the moment the world realized they were watching someone impossible.</p>
