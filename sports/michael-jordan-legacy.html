<h1>Michael Jordan and the Art of Winning</h1>
<p class="meta">Sports · Basketball</p>
<p>Six championships. Five MVPs. Zero Finals losses. Jordan didn't just win — he defined what winning meant.</p>
<h2>The Competitive Obsession</h2>
<p>Jordan made up slights. He turned every interaction into motivation. It was pathological — and effective. He needed enemies to fuel greatness.</p>
<h2>The Flu Game</h2>
<p>1997 NBA Finals, Game 5. Food poisoning or hangover, depending who you ask. Jordan scored 38 points anyway. That's the legend in a single moment.</p>
<h2>The Last Dance</h2>
<p>The ESPN documentary showed the cost. Jordan was ruthless with teammates. He demanded perfection. Some call it leadership. Others call it toxicity.</p>
<h2>The GOAT Debate</h2>
<p>LeBron has the stats. Jordan has the aura. Six-for-six in Finals. Perfect when it mattered most. That's hard to argue against.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Jordan didn't just play basketball. He weaponized competitiveness. Whether that's admirable or cautionary depends on who you ask.</p>
