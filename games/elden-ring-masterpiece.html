            <h1>Elden Ring: The Art of Silent Narrative</h1>

            <p class="meta">Gaming · Action RPG</p>

            <p>
                Elden Ring doesn't just give you a story; it makes you find it. In a world where most games use hours of
                cutscenes, FromSoftware uses the environment itself.
            </p>

            <h2>The Lands Between: A Living Text</h2>
            <p>
                Every ruin in Elden Ring has a history. The placement of a statue or the presence of specific enemies in
                an area tells a story of a war long ago or a god's fall from grace.
            </p>

            <h2>Narrative Through Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                The true lore is hidden in item descriptions. A simple sword isn't just a weapon; it's a window into the
                life of the person who once wielded it.
            </p>

            <h2>The Player's Role</h2>
            <p>
                You aren't just a protagonist; you're an archaeologist. The satisfaction comes not just from defeating
                bosses, but from piecing together why they were there in the first place.
