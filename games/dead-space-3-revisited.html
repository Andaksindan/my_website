            <h1>Dead Space 3: Terror in the Tundra</h1>

            <p class="meta">Gaming · Survival Horror</p>

            <p>
                Dead Space 3 often gets a bad wrap for leaning into action, but revisited today, it remains a
                fascinating and highly polished experience.
            </p>

            <h2>The Frozen Desert</h2>
            <p>
                Tau Volantis provides a stark contrast to the cramped corridors of the Ishimura. The sense of isolation
                in a vast, white wasteland is palpable.
            </p>

            <h2>The Weapon Bench</h2>
            <p>
                The crafting system in DS3 was ahead of its time. The level of customization allowed players to truly
                build tools of survival that fit their playstyle.
            </p>

            <h2>Cosmic Horror at Scale</h2>
            <p>
                While it lost some of the intimate horror of the first two, the scale of the threat in Dead Space 3 —
                the Brother Moons — remains one of the most chilling concepts in sci-fi horror.
