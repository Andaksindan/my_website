            <h1>Skyrim: A Decade in the North</h1>

            <p class="meta">Gaming · Open World RPG</p>

            <p>
                More than ten years later, we still find ourselves starting a new game in Skyrim. What is it about this
                world that refuses to age?
            </p>

            <h2>The Freedom of Choice</h2>
            <p>
                Skyrim's greatest strength is its lack of restriction. You can be a legendary mage, a stealthy thief, or
                just a hunter in the woods. The world doesn't force you into a role; it gives you a space to exist.
            </p>

            <h2>Atmosphere and Music</h2>
            <p>
                Jeremy Soule's soundtrack and the haunting beauty of the snowy mountains create a sense of place that
                few games have matched. It's a world that feels vast and alive.
            </p>

            <h2>A Sandbox of Stories</h2>
            <p>
                The best stories in Skyrim aren't the scripted quests, but the things that happen purely by chance. A
                dragon attacking a village while you're trying to sell gear — these are the moments that stick.
