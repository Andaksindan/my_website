            <h1>Valheim: Simplicity in Survival</h1>

            <p class="meta">Gaming · Survival RPG</p>

            <p>
                Valheim took the gaming world by storm not by being complex, but by being smart. It respects the
                player's time while providing a deep, rewarding loop.
            </p>

            <h2>The Low-Fi Aesthetic</h2>
            <p>
                The game's combination of low-poly models and modern lighting effects creates a unique, nostalgic, and
                beautiful look that proves art direction beats pixel count.
            </p>

            <h2>The Joy of the Voyage</h2>
            <p>
                Sailing in Valheim is an experience in itself. Watching the storm roll in or the sun set over the ocean
                while carrying a boatload of ore is both tense and relaxing.
            </p>

            <h2>Building a Home</h2>
            <p>
                The physics-based building system makes every shelter feel like a real accomplishment. It's not just
                about placing blocks; it's about structural integrity and hearth.
