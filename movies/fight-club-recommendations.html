<p class="meta">Movies · Psychological Thrillers</p>

<p>
Fight Club wasn’t just a movie — it was a confrontation. With identity,
consumerism, masculinity, and self-destruction. If it hit you hard,
these films operate in the same psychological territory.
</p>

<h2>Memories of Murder</h2>
<p>
A slow-burning descent into obsession. Like Fight Club, this film
focuses on how failure erodes identity. It’s not about solving the crime
— it’s about what the pursuit does to the people chasing it.
</p>

<h2>Prisoners (2013)</h2>
<p>
Hugh Jackman delivers one of his darkest performances. Moral boundaries
collapse, and the film asks the same uncomfortable question Fight Club
does: when pushed, who are you really?
</p>

<h2>The Chaser</h2>
<p>
Relentless and exhausting in the best way. It strips away the fantasy of
heroism and replaces it with desperation, rage, and consequence.
</p>

<h2>I Saw the Devil</h2>
<p>
This is revenge with no catharsis. The further it goes, the less
satisfying it becomes — mirroring Fight Club’s warning about violence
and control.
</p>

<h2>Talaash (2012)</h2>
<p>
An underrated Indian psychological thriller. Grief, guilt, and mystery
intertwine, making it far deeper than it first appears.
</p>

<h2>Drishyam</h2>
<p>
A masterclass in quiet intelligence. Like Fight Club, it’s about
outthinking the system — but with devastating emotional stakes.
</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>
These films don’t comfort. They challenge. If Fight Club stayed with
you, these will too.
