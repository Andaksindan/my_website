<h1>No Country for Old Men: Violence Without Meaning</h1>
<p class="meta">Movies · Crime Thriller</p>

<p>The Coen Brothers made a film with no score, no easy answers, and no satisfying conclusion. It's brutal, deliberate, and unforgettable.</p>

<h2>Anton Chigurh: Evil Incarnate</h2>
<p>He's not a villain with a backstory. He's fate itself — unstoppable, indifferent, and terrifying. Javier Bardem's performance is iconic for a reason.</p>

<h2>Llewelyn Moss: The Doomed Protagonist</h2>
<p>He makes one mistake. Everything after is consequence. The film denies him a heroic death because that's not how real violence works.</p>

<h2>Sheriff Ed Tom Bell: The Old Guard</h2>
<p>Tommy Lee Jones embodies exhaustion. He's a man who realizes the world has moved past him, and he can't stop it. His final monologue is devastating.</p>

<h2>The Ending That Frustrated Everyone</h2>
<p>No climactic showdown. No justice. Just acceptance of a world that no longer makes sense. It's not satisfying — it's honest.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>No Country for Old Men doesn't comfort. It confronts. And it asks: what do you do when the old rules no longer apply?</p>
