<h1>The Prestige: Obsession vs. Magic</h1>
<p class="meta">Movies · Psychological Thriller</p>

<p>Christopher Nolan's most underrated film. It's about magic, but really it's about two men destroying themselves over a grudge that never needed to exist.</p>

<h2>The Structure: A Magic Trick Itself</h2>
<p>The film is told in three acts — The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. It reveals itself the way a magician reveals a trick: misdirection, then the brutal truth.</p>

<h2>Borden vs. Angier: Two Approaches to Obsession</h2>
<p>Borden sacrifices everything for his craft. Angier sacrifices everything for revenge. One is an artist. The other is a man possessed. Both lose.</p>

<h2>The Twist That Changes Everything</h2>
<p>Borden's secret is revealed. Angier's horror is revealed. And suddenly the entire film recontextualizes. Every scene means something different.</p>

<h2>Tesla and the Cost of Perfection</h2>
<p>David Bowie's Tesla offers Angier the ultimate trick — at the ultimate cost. Angier takes it. And what follows is one of cinema's darkest acts of dedication.</p>

<h2>The Final Prestige</h2>
<p>Angier wins. But at what cost? His victory is hollow. His revenge is meaningless. And he dies knowing he became the monster he feared.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Prestige asks: how far would you go to be the best? And when you get there, was it worth it? The answer is devastating.</p>
