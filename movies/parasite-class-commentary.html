<h1>Parasite and Class Warfare</h1>
<p class="meta">Movies · Thriller</p>

<p>Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece isn't subtle about class. It's operatic, darkly comedic, and ultimately tragic. And it deserved every award it won.</p>

<h2>The Con That Feels Too Real</h2>
<p>The Kim family infiltrates the Park household one by one. It's clever, funny, and increasingly uncomfortable as you realize how desperate they are.</p>

<h2>The Basement Reveal</h2>
<p>Halfway through, the film shifts. What seemed like a dark comedy becomes a horror movie. The revelation of what's hidden below changes everything.</p>

<h2>No Heroes, Only Victims</h2>
<p>The Kims aren't heroes. The Parks aren't villains. They're all trapped in a system that pits them against each other while the real problem goes unaddressed.</p>

<h2>The Final Act: Chaos and Consequence</h2>
<p>The birthday party descends into violence. Not because anyone is evil — but because desperation, humiliation, and resentment explode at once.</p>

<h2>The Ending: A Dream Deferred</h2>
<p>Ki-woo's plan to buy the house and free his father is heartbreaking. It's mathematically impossible. And that's the point.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Parasite works because it doesn't preach. It shows. And what it shows is a world where upward mobility is a fantasy sold to keep people hoping.</p>
