<h1>Rolex Submariner: Hype or Heritage?</h1>
<p class="meta">Watches · Dive Watch</p>
<p>The most recognizable watch in the world. But is it the best? Or just the most hyped?</p>
<h2>The History</h2>
<p>Launched in 1953 as a tool watch for divers. Over decades, it became a status symbol. James Bond wore one. So did Steve McQueen. Heritage was built.</p>
<h2>What Makes It Special</h2>
<p>In-house movement, ceramic bezel, 300m water resistance. It's built to last generations. The finishing is impeccable. It wears smaller than you'd think.</p>
<h2>The Hype Problem</h2>
<p>Waitlists are years long. Gray market prices are double retail. It's become an investment asset more than a watch. That changes how people wear it.</p>
<h2>Is It Worth It?</h2>
<p>At retail? Absolutely. On the gray market at $15k? Questionable. There are better watches for that price. But none with the Rolex mystique.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Submariner is iconic for a reason. But the hype has eclipsed the watch itself. That's both its strength and its problem.</p>
