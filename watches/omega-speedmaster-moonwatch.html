<h1>Omega Speedmaster: The Moon Watch Legacy</h1>
<p class="meta">Watches · Chronograph</p>
<p>The only watch worn on the moon. That alone makes it legendary. But there's more to it.</p>
<h2>The NASA Connection</h2>
<p>In 1965, NASA tested every chronograph they could find. The Speedmaster survived. It's been flight-qualified ever since.</p>
<h2>Apollo 11 and Buzz Aldrin</h2>
<p>July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong left his Speedmaster in the lunar module. Buzz Aldrin wore his on the moon. History was made.</p>
<h2>Why It's Still Relevant</h2>
<p>Manual-wind movement. Hesalite crystal. No date complication. It's the same watch astronauts wore. That's rare in modern watchmaking.</p>
<h2>The Community</h2>
<p>Speedmaster owners are obsessive. They track serial numbers, production years, dial variations. It's a rabbit hole with no bottom.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Speedmaster isn't just a watch. It's a piece of space exploration history you can wear. That's irreplaceable.</p>
