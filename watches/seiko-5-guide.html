<h1>Seiko 5: The Perfect First Watch</h1>
<p class="meta">Watches · Affordable Mechanical</p>
<p>Mechanical movement. Under $100. Reliable. This is where watch collecting begins.</p>
<h2>What Is the Seiko 5?</h2>
<p>A line of affordable automatic watches. In-house movement, day-date complication, water resistance. No battery needed. Just wear it, and it winds itself.</p>
<h2>Why It's the Gateway Watch</h2>
<p>It's cheap enough to buy on impulse but good enough to keep forever. You learn about mechanical watches without financial risk.</p>
<h2>The Modding Community</h2>
<p>Seiko 5s are endlessly moddable. Swap the dial, hands, bezel. The community has turned customization into an art form.</p>
<h2>Which Model to Buy</h2>
<p>The SNK809 is the classic field watch. The SRPD is the modern diver. The SNK803 is the minimalist choice. You can't go wrong.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Every watch enthusiast owns or has owned a Seiko 5. It's a rite of passage — and a damn good watch.</p>
