<h1>G-Shock: The Indestructible Icon</h1>
<p class="meta">Watches · Digital Tool Watch</p>
<p>From construction sites to fashion runways. The G-Shock conquered every space imaginable.</p>
<h2>The Origin Story</h2>
<p>Kikuo Ibe dropped his father's watch. It broke. He vowed to create an indestructible watch. After 200 prototypes, the G-Shock was born in 1983.</p>
<h2>The DW-5600: The OG</h2>
<p>Square case. Resin strap. Shock-resistant. Water-resistant. This is the G-Shock everyone knows. It's been in production for 40 years.</p>
<h2>The Fashion Crossover</h2>
<p>Streetwear adopted G-Shock. Collaborations with BAPE, Stüssy, and luxury brands followed. A tool watch became a fashion statement.</p>
<h2>Why It Endures</h2>
<p>You can't kill it. Drop it, submerge it, wear it for decades. It keeps working. That reliability built a cult following.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The G-Shock is proof that utility and style can coexist. It's a watch that doesn't care what you think — and that's why people love it.</p>
