<h1>Grand Seiko and the Art of Finishing</h1>
<p class="meta">Watches · Luxury Mechanical</p>
<p>Swiss watches get the hype. Grand Seiko gets the finishing. If you know, you know.</p>
<h2>What Is Grand Seiko?</h2>
<p>Seiko's luxury line. In-house movements, Zaratsu polishing, dial craftsmanship that rivals anything Swiss. Understated, flawless, Japanese.</p>
<h2>The Snowflake</h2>
<p>The SBGA211 "Snowflake" is iconic. Spring Drive movement, textured dial inspired by snowdrifts. It's art you wear.</p>
<h2>Why It's Underrated</h2>
<p>No brand cachet. It says "Seiko" on the dial, which some people associate with affordable watches. But those who know recognize the craftsmanship.</p>
<h2>The Spring Drive Movement</h2>
<p>Mechanical watch with quartz accuracy. The second hand sweeps like silk. It's engineering poetry.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Grand Seiko doesn't scream. It whispers. And if you're listening, it's one of the best watches made today.</p>
