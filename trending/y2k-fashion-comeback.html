<h1>The Return of Y2K Fashion</h1>
<p class="meta">Trending · Fashion</p>
<p>Low-rise jeans, butterfly clips, and velour tracksuits are back. Gen Z is raiding the early 2000s — and it's more than just nostalgia.</p>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>Fashion cycles every 20-30 years. We've done the '90s. Now it's the 2000s' turn. But there's also a longing for pre-smartphone optimism that Y2K represents.</p>
<h2>What's Actually Coming Back</h2>
<p>Cargo pants, baby tees, chunky sneakers, mini skirts, and anything bedazzled. Brands like Juicy Couture are literally being resurrected.</p>
<h2>The TikTok Effect</h2>
<p>Y2K fashion spread through TikTok. Users found old outfits in thrift stores, styled them, and made them viral. The algorithm did the rest.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
