<h1>AI Art and the Death of Creativity?</h1>
<p class="meta">Trending · Technology</p>
<p>AI can now generate images from text prompts. Artists are furious. Tech enthusiasts are thrilled. The debate is messy.</p>
<h2>The Tools: Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion</h2>
<p>Type a prompt. Get an image in seconds. The results range from derivative to genuinely impressive. The barrier to creation has never been lower.</p>
<h2>The Artist's Argument</h2>
<p>AI models are trained on copyrighted work without permission. It's theft laundered through algorithms. And it devalues human labor.</p>
<h2>The Techno-Optimist View</h2>
<p>AI democratizes creativity. Anyone can make art now. It's a tool, not a replacement. Photography didn't kill painting — this won't kill art.</p>
<h2>The Real Issue: Labor</h2>
<p>AI isn't killing creativity. It's threatening creative livelihoods. Concept artists, illustrators, and designers are already losing work.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>AI art isn't going away. The question is: how do we value human creativity in a world where machines can mimic it?</p>
