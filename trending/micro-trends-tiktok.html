<h1>The Rise of Micro-Trends</h1>
<p class="meta">Trending · Culture</p>
<p>Trends used to last years. Now they last weeks. TikTok accelerated culture to an unsustainable speed.</p>
<h2>What Are Micro-Trends?</h2>
<p>Aesthetic movements that explode, saturate, and die within months. Think "clean girl aesthetic" or "blokecore." They rise fast and burn out faster.</p>
<h2>TikTok's Role</h2>
<p>The algorithm rewards novelty. Once something goes viral, everyone copies it. Then everyone gets bored. The cycle repeats endlessly.</p>
<h2>The Environmental Cost</h2>
<p>Fast fashion thrives on micro-trends. Shein produces new styles weekly to keep up. The waste is staggering.</p>
<h2>The Fatigue Is Real</h2>
<p>People are exhausted. Keeping up with trends is now a full-time job. The backlash is building toward timeless, slow fashion.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Micro-trends are unsustainable — culturally, environmentally, mentally. Something has to give.</p>
