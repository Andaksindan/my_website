<h1>Dopamine Fasting: Pseudo-Science or Self-Care?</h1>
<p class="meta">Trending · Wellness</p>
<p>Silicon Valley's latest trend: abstaining from pleasure to "reset" your brain. The science says otherwise.</p>
<h2>What Is Dopamine Fasting?</h2>
<p>Avoiding all pleasurable activities — social media, food, music, conversation — to supposedly reset dopamine receptors and increase motivation.</p>
<h2>The Science Says No</h2>
<p>Neuroscientists have debunked this. You can't "fast" from dopamine. It's a neurotransmitter your brain always produces. The concept is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<h2>What People Are Actually Doing</h2>
<p>Taking breaks from overstimulation. Which is good! But calling it "dopamine fasting" misrepresents the biology and sounds pretentious.</p>
<h2>The Real Benefit</h2>
<p>Digital detoxes work. Not because of dopamine, but because they give your attention a break. The branding is just Silicon Valley self-optimization theater.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Take breaks from your phone. Just don't pretend it's neuroscience.</p>
