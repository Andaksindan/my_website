<h1>Quiet Luxury: The New Status Symbol</h1>
<p class="meta">Trending · Lifestyle</p>
<p>No logos. No flash. Just obscenely expensive clothing that looks understated. Welcome to quiet luxury.</p>
<h2>What Is Quiet Luxury?</h2>
<p>It's Loro Piana cashmere, Hermès scarves without the H, and $800 plain white t-shirts. The point isn't to flex — it's to signal wealth to those who know.</p>
<h2>Why Logomania Died</h2>
<p>Logomania peaked and became gauche. Now the truly rich want to separate themselves from people with knockoffs. Quiet luxury is gatekeeping through knowledge.</p>
<h2>The Role of Succession</h2>
<p>The show popularized this aesthetic. Kendall Roy's Loro Piana baseball cap became a cultural touchstone. Everyone wanted to dress like a billionaire in crisis.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Quiet luxury isn't humble — it's the ultimate flex. It says: "I don't need to prove anything to you."</p>
