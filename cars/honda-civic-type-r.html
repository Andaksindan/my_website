<h1>Honda Civic Type R: Functional Insanity</h1>
<p class="meta">Cars · Hot Hatch</p>
<p>Front-wheel drive. 300+ horsepower. A boy racer aesthetic. It shouldn't work. But it does.</p>
<h2>The Design: Love It or Hate It</h2>
<p>Fake vents. Giant wing. Aggressive angles. The Type R looks absurd. But every piece has a purpose. Function dictated form.</p>
<h2>The Performance</h2>
<p>It's fast. Lap times embarrass cars twice its price. The chassis is brilliant. The engine screams to redline. It's deeply serious about being fun.</p>
<h2>Front-Wheel Drive Mastery</h2>
<p>FWD is supposed to understeer and torque steer. Honda engineered both out. The Type R rotates like it's rear-drive. That's witchcraft.</p>
<h2>Daily Drivability</h2>
<p>It's a Civic underneath. Reliable, practical, comfortable. You can commute Monday and track it Saturday. That versatility is rare.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Type R is polarizing by design. But on track, on backroads, in the corners — it's one of the best driver's cars you can buy.</p>
