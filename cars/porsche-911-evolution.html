<h1>Porsche 911: Evolution Without Revolution</h1>
<p class="meta">Cars · Sports Car</p>
<p>60 years. Same silhouette. Constant refinement. The 911 is proof that perfection is iterative.</p>
<h2>The Original: 1963</h2>
<p>Rear-engine, air-cooled, flawed but brilliant. The 911 was a compromise that became iconic. Every generation since has refined the formula.</p>
<h2>Why Rear-Engine Works</h2>
<p>Weight over the driven wheels. Better traction. But also snap oversteer and handling quirks. Porsche spent decades taming it without losing the character.</p>
<h2>The Air-Cooled Era</h2>
<p>1963–1998. Mechanical, visceral, loud. Prices for air-cooled 911s have skyrocketed. Collectors want the analog experience.</p>
<h2>The Modern Era</h2>
<p>Water-cooled, turbocharged, electronically assisted. Faster, safer, more capable. Some purists hate it. Most people love it.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The 911 proves you don't need to reinvent. Just refine, endlessly. That's how you build a legend.</p>
