<h1>Toyota Supra MK4: Hype or Legend?</h1>
<p class="meta">Cars · Sports Car</p>
<p>The Fast & Furious effect is real. But the Supra earned its reputation long before Hollywood.</p>
<h2>The 2JZ Engine</h2>
<p>Bulletproof. Over-engineered. Capable of handling 1000+ horsepower with upgrades. Toyota built it to last forever — tuners made it legendary.</p>
<h2>The Design</h2>
<p>Curvy, aggressive, timeless. The MK4 Supra still looks modern 30 years later. That's rare in automotive design.</p>
<h2>The Fast & Furious Explosion</h2>
<p>Before 2001, Supras were affordable. After? Prices skyrocketed. The movie turned it into a cultural icon. Collectors took notice.</p>
<h2>Is It Overpriced Now?</h2>
<p>Yes. Clean examples sell for $100k+. But the platform is genuinely great. The hype inflated prices, but the legend was already there.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Supra is both hyped and legendary. The hype came from pop culture. The legend came from engineering excellence.</p>
