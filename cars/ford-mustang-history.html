<h1>Ford Mustang: America's Muscle Car</h1>
<p class="meta">Cars · Muscle Car</p>
<p>60 years in production. Through oil crises, emissions regulations, and changing tastes. The Mustang endures.</p>
<h2>The Birth: 1964</h2>
<p>Ford wanted a sporty, affordable car for young buyers. They nailed it. The Mustang sold over a million units in its first two years.</p>
<h2>The Muscle Era: 1967-1973</h2>
<p>Big engines. V8s. Shelby GT500s. This is the Mustang everyone remembers. Raw power, minimal refinement, maximum attitude.</p>
<h2>The Dark Years: 1974-1993</h2>
<p>The Mustang II was a Pinto in a costume. The Fox Body saved it — affordable, moddable, and RWD. Tuners loved it.</p>
<h2>The Modern Era</h2>
<p>2005 brought retro styling. 2015 brought independent rear suspension. The Mustang became a real sports car while keeping its identity.</p>
<h2>The Electric Mustang Controversy</h2>
<p>The Mach-E is an SUV. Calling it a Mustang angered purists. But it's selling well. The nameplate is evolving — again.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Mustang survived because Ford adapted without losing its soul. V8, RWD, affordable performance. That formula still works.</p>
