<h1>Tesla Model S: The EV That Changed Everything</h1>
<p class="meta">Cars · Electric Sedan</p>
<p>Before the Model S, EVs were compromises. Slow, ugly, impractical. Tesla made them desirable. The industry followed.</p>
<h2>The Launch: 2012</h2>
<p>300+ mile range. 0-60 in under 4 seconds. Over-the-air updates. The Model S wasn't an EV — it was a tech product disguised as a car.</p>
<h2>The Supercharger Network</h2>
<p>Tesla didn't just build a car. They built infrastructure. Road trips became possible. Range anxiety faded. Other automakers scrambled.</p>
<h2>The Build Quality Issues</h2>
<p>Panel gaps. Interior quality. Reliability concerns. The Model S wasn't perfect. But people bought it anyway because the experience was unlike anything else.</p>
<h2>The Industry Shift</h2>
<p>Every automaker is now making EVs. Porsche, Mercedes, BMW — all chasing Tesla. The Model S forced the industry to evolve or die.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Model S isn't the best car Tesla makes anymore. But it's the one that mattered. It proved EVs could be fast, luxurious, and desirable.</p>
