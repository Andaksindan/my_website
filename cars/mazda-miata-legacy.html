<h1>Mazda Miata: The People's Sports Car</h1>
<p class="meta">Cars · Roadster</p>
<p>Not the fastest. Not the most powerful. But the most fun. That's why the Miata has survived 35 years.</p>
<h2>The Philosophy: Lightweight and Balance</h2>
<p>Mazda built the Miata on a simple idea: less weight, more driver connection. No turbos. No tech overload. Just a car that responds.</p>
<h2>Why It's Always the Answer</h2>
<p>"What car should I buy?" The answer is always Miata. Affordable, reliable, moddable, and pure driving joy. The meme is real.</p>
<h2>The Generations</h2>
<p>NA (1989): The original. Pop-up headlights and charm. NB (1998): Refined. NC (2005): Bigger, softer. ND (2015): Back to basics — and perfect.</p>
<h2>The Track Day Hero</h2>
<p>Miatas dominate grassroots racing. Spec Miata is the most competitive class in club racing. Cheap to run, easy to fix, endlessly fun.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>The Miata proves you don't need horsepower to have fun. You need balance, lightness, and soul. Mazda nailed it — and never stopped.</p>
