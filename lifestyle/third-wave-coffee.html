<h1>Coffee Culture and the Third Wave</h1>
<p class="meta">Lifestyle · Food & Drink</p>
<p>Coffee went from commodity to craft. Now it's wine-level snobbery — and that's not entirely a bad thing.</p>
<h2>The Three Waves</h2>
<p>First wave: Folgers, Maxwell House. Coffee as fuel. Second wave: Starbucks, espresso drinks. Third wave: single-origin, pour-over, precision.</p>
<h2>What Makes Third Wave Different</h2>
<p>Direct trade with farmers. Light roasts that preserve flavor. Manual brewing. Every variable controlled. Coffee as art.</p>
<h2>The Snobbery Problem</h2>
<p>Baristas lecture you about tasting notes. $7 pour-overs. Gatekeeping. The culture can be alienating.</p>
<h2>The Good Part</h2>
<p>Farmers get paid fairly. Quality improved dramatically. People care about what they're drinking. That's progress.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Third-wave coffee elevated the craft. But don't let anyone shame you for liking what you like. Drink good coffee. Ignore the snobs.</p>
