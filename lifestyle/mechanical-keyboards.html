<h1>Why Everyone Wants a Mechanical Keyboard</h1>
<p class="meta">Lifestyle · Tech</p>
<p>Clicky switches. Custom keycaps. Endless modifications. Mechanical keyboards became a hobby — and an obsession.</p>
<h2>What Makes Them Different?</h2>
<p>Each key has its own switch. Tactile feedback. Satisfying sound. Durability. It's a sensory experience, not just typing.</p>
<h2>The Customization Rabbit Hole</h2>
<p>Hot-swappable switches, custom keycaps, lubricants, stabilizers, foam mods. People spend hundreds building the perfect board.</p>
<h2>The Sound</h2>
<p>Cherry MX Blues are clicky. Reds are linear. Browns are tactile but quiet. Enthusiasts chase the "thock" — deep, resonant keystrokes.</p>
<h2>The Community</h2>
<p>r/MechanicalKeyboards is 2 million strong. Group buys, artisan keycaps, Discord servers. It's a subculture with its own language.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Mechanical keyboards are functional art. You use them every day. Why not make that experience enjoyable?</p>
