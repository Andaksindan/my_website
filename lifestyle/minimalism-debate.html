<h1>Minimalism: Philosophy or Privilege?</h1>
<p class="meta">Lifestyle · Philosophy</p>
<p>Owning less. Living intentionally. But is minimalism wisdom or wealth signaling?</p>
<h2>The Philosophy</h2>
<p>Minimalism is about removing excess to focus on what matters. Less clutter, fewer distractions, more meaning. That part is valuable.</p>
<h2>The Aesthetic</h2>
<p>White walls. Empty shelves. Expensive "nothing." This version of minimalism is Instagram-friendly and costly. It's not about less — it's about curated emptiness.</p>
<h2>The Privilege Question</h2>
<p>Choosing to own less requires financial security. Poor people don't hoard by choice — they hold onto things because replacement is expensive. Minimalism as a trend ignores this.</p>
<h2>The Useful Part</h2>
<p>Intentionality is good. Questioning consumption is good. But minimalism shouldn't be a performance or a moral high ground.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Minimalism as a philosophy: valuable. Minimalism as an aesthetic: often performative. Know the difference.</p>
