<h1>The Rise of Third Spaces</h1>
<p class="meta">Lifestyle · Community</p>
<p>Not home. Not work. Somewhere in between. Third spaces are social infrastructure — and we're losing them.</p>
<h2>What Are Third Spaces?</h2>
<p>Coffee shops, libraries, parks, bookstores, community centers. Places to exist without the obligation to produce or consume. Just… be.</p>
<h2>Why They Matter</h2>
<p>They foster community, reduce isolation, and create accidental social connections. They're where you meet neighbors, overhear conversations, feel part of something.</p>
<h2>The Decline</h2>
<p>Malls closed. Libraries underfunded. Parks commercialized. Loitering criminalized. Third spaces are disappearing, replaced by private, transactional environments.</p>
<h2>The Coffee Shop Paradox</h2>
<p>Starbucks filled the void. But they're not true third spaces — they're businesses optimizing for turnover. You're welcome as long as you buy.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Loneliness is an epidemic. Third spaces are the cure. We need to protect and rebuild them before they're gone entirely.</p>
