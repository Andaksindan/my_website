<h1>Slow Living in a Fast World</h1>
<p class="meta">Lifestyle · Philosophy</p>
<p>Hustle culture is dying. In its place: intentional routines, fewer choices, and the permission to rest.</p>
<h2>What Is Slow Living?</h2>
<p>Doing less, better. Prioritizing presence over productivity. Cooking instead of ordering. Walking instead of driving. It's resistance to acceleration.</p>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>Burnout became ubiquitous. People realized grinding doesn't lead to fulfillment. Slow living is the backlash.</p>
<h2>The Practical Side</h2>
<p>Fewer apps. Simpler meals. Morning routines without urgency. It's not about rejecting modernity — it's about using it selectively.</p>
<h2>The Privilege Critique</h2>
<p>Slow living requires time and money. Not everyone can afford to "slow down." Acknowledging this matters.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Slow living isn't laziness. It's intentionality. And in a world optimized for speed, choosing slowness is radical.</p>
