<h1>The Return of Vinyl Records</h1>
<p class="meta">Lifestyle · Music</p>
<p>Vinyl sales are at a 30-year high. CDs are dead. Streaming is convenient. So why vinyl?</p>
<h2>The Analog Appeal</h2>
<p>Warmth, crackle, imperfection. Vinyl sounds different — not necessarily better, but more tactile, more present.</p>
<h2>The Ritual</h2>
<p>You can't skip. You have to flip sides. You interact with the music. It's intentional listening in an age of passive streaming.</p>
<h2>The Collectibility</h2>
<p>Album art matters again. Limited pressings. Colored variants. Vinyl is a physical artifact you can display, collect, own.</p>
<h2>The Nostalgia Factor</h2>
<p>Gen Z didn't grow up with vinyl. But they're driving the resurgence. It's retro cool — and a rejection of digital ephemerality.</p>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Vinyl isn't practical. That's the point. It's a deliberate choice to slow down and engage with music differently.</p>
