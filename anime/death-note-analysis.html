      <p>
        Let's be honest: Death Note's first half is a masterpiece. The second half? Frustrating. But understanding where
        it peaked — and why it fell — makes it a better experience.
      </p>

      <h2>The First Half: Chess With Lives</h2>
      <p>
        Light versus L. Every episode is a mind game. The tension is unbearable. The strategies are brilliant. This is
        peak Death Note — two geniuses locked in battle, each move calculated, each mistake fatal.
      </p>

      <h2>Light Yagami: The Protagonist You Root Against</h2>
      <p>
        Light isn't a hero. He's a narcissist with a god complex. But he's compelling because the show never pretends
        otherwise. Watching his descent is the entire point.
      </p>

      <h2>L: The Eccentric Genius</h2>
      <p>
        L is weird, brilliant, and morally ambiguous. His methods are questionable. His deductions are flawless. The
        cat-and-mouse dynamic between him and Light is what makes the show work.
      </p>

      <h2>The Decline After Episode 25</h2>
      <p>
        When L exits, the show loses its center. The new characters don't have the same weight. The stakes feel
        manufactured. It's not bad — it's just a shadow of what came before.
      </p>

      <h2>The Ending: Poetic Justice</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the middle dragging, the finale delivers. Light's downfall is brutal, pathetic, and earned. He dies
        alone, screaming, exactly as he deserved.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thought</h2>
      <p>
        Death Note is worth watching for the first half alone. The second half is flawed, but the ending redeems it.
        Just know what you're getting into.
