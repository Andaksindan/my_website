      <p class="meta">Anime · Psychological Thriller</p>

      <p>
        Monster is 74 episodes of slow-burn perfection. No superpowers. No fantasy. Just a doctor chasing the monster he
        saved, questioning if saving a life is always the right choice.
      </p>

      <h2>The Premise: Morality in Medicine</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Tenma saves a boy's life instead of the mayor's. The boy grows up to become a serial killer. Now Tenma must
        stop him — or die trying. It's a thriller built on a single ethical dilemma.
      </p>

      <h2>Johan Liebert: Pure Evil or Broken Human?</h2>
      <p>
        Johan is terrifying because he's calm, intelligent, and almost philosophical in his nihilism. He doesn't just
        kill. He manipulates people into destroying themselves. He's one of anime's greatest villains.
      </p>

      <h2>The Pacing: Trust the Process</h2>
      <p>
        Monster doesn't rush. It explores every character, every motive, every consequence. Some episodes barely move
        the plot — but they deepen the world. By the end, every piece matters.
      </p>

      <h2>The European Setting</h2>
      <p>
        Post-Cold War Germany, Czech Republic, the shadows of history. Monster feels different because it's grounded in
        real-world politics, trauma, and institutional corruption.
      </p>

      <h2>The Question at the Heart</h2>
      <p>
        Was saving Johan the right choice? Should Tenma kill him now to atone? Is all life equal, even a monster's? The
        show never answers definitively — and that's the point.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thought</h2>
      <p>
        Monster is slow, dense, and requires patience. But if you let it breathe, it becomes one of the most mature,
        morally complex stories anime has ever told.
